# ADAShield - Product Overview

## Product Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Product Name** | ADAShield |
| **Tagline** | "Shield your business from ADA lawsuits" |
| **Product Type** | SaaS Web Accessibility Testing Platform |
| **Category** | Testing Tool (NOT an overlay/widget) |

## Product Purpose

ADAShield is an honest, AI-enhanced web accessibility testing tool that helps businesses achieve WCAG/ADA compliance. Unlike overlay widgets that provide false promises, ADAShield provides transparent, actionable testing results that accurately identify accessibility issues.

### Core Problem Solved

1. **Lawsuit Risk**: 4,000+ ADA lawsuits filed annually, 77% targeting e-commerce/SMBs
2. **False Solutions**: Overlay widgets attract MORE lawsuits (25% of cases involve widget users)
3. **Compliance Deadlines**: ADA Title II (Apr 2026), EAA (Jun 2025) creating urgency
4. **Lack of Transparency**: Competitors overpromise automated detection capabilities

### Our Honest Positioning

```
Traditional automated testing: ~57% of issues detected
+ AI enhancement:             ~75-85% of issues detected
+ Human review:               ~95%+ of issues detected

We are transparent about what automation CAN and CANNOT do.
```

## Product Principles

### 1. Honesty Over Hype

We never claim 100% automated compliance. We clearly communicate:
- What we CAN detect automatically (~57% with axe-core, ~75-85% with AI)
- What REQUIRES human review
- Why overlays/widgets don't work

### 2. Developer-First

- Clean API and CLI tools
- CI/CD integration is first-class
- Technical documentation is comprehensive
- Open about our methodology (axe-core based)

### 3. Actionable Results

Every issue reported includes:
- What the problem is
- Why it matters (WCAG reference)
- How to fix it (code examples)
- Priority/severity rating

### 4. Privacy-Conscious

- Minimal data collection
- Downloaded sites deleted after analysis
- GDPR compliant
- No selling of customer data
