**Created:** December 25, 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the go-to-market strategy for an ADA/WCAG compliance testing tool, designed for a solo software engineer to execute. The strategy focuses on parallel execution of validation and distribution channels, with emphasis on agency partnerships for scalable revenue.

---

## 🗺️ Parallel Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-3)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Core scanner | Build using axe-core + Pa11y |
| Report generator | PDF/HTML output with actionable insights |
| Landing page | Basic page with waitlist signup |

### Phase 2+3 Combined: Validation + Distribution (Weeks 4-10)

Execute three tracks simultaneously:

```
Week 4-10
│
├── Track A: Manual Revenue (lower effort, ongoing)
│   ├── Fiverr/Upwork listings
│   ├── Reddit/community free scans → paid conversions
│   └── Collect testimonials
│
├── Track B: Build Distribution (higher effort)
│   ├── Week 4-5: Chrome Extension
│   ├── Week 6-8: WordPress Plugin
│   └── Week 9-10: Agency outreach campaign
│
└── Track C: Content (background task)
    ├── 1 blog post/week about ADA deadlines
    └── SEO for "ADA compliance checker", "WCAG tester"
```

### Phase 4: Scale (Month 4+)

| Task | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Shopify app | High |
| Expand agency partnerships | High |
| API for developers | Medium |
| Evaluate paid acquisition | Medium |

---

## 🔌 Platform Plugin Priority

| Platform | Audience | Difficulty | Priority |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Chrome Extension** | Developers, agencies | Easy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Build first) |
| **WordPress** | 43% of all websites | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Shopify** | E-commerce (77% of lawsuits) | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **GitHub Action** | Dev teams, CI/CD | Easy | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Wix/Squarespace** | SMBs | Harder | ⭐⭐ |

---

## 🤝 Agency & Freelancer Partnership Strategy

### Why This Channel?

- **High leverage:** One agency = dozens of client websites
- **Recurring revenue:** Agencies need ongoing compliance monitoring
- **Low acquisition cost:** Relationship-based, not ad-dependent
- **Trust transfer:** Agency recommends you to their clients

### Target Segments

| Segment | Why They Need You | Where to Find |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Small web agencies (2-10 people)** | Need to offer accessibility but can't build in-house | Clutch.co, DesignRush, local directories |
| **WordPress freelancers** | Clients asking about ADA compliance | r/ProWordPress, WordPress meetups, Upwork |
| **Shopify developers** | E-commerce = 77% of lawsuits | Shopify Partner directory, r/shopify |
| **Marketing agencies** | Manage client websites, need compliance reports | LinkedIn, local business groups |
| **Law firms (web presence teams)** | They get sued too | Direct outreach |

### Partnership Models

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **White-label reports** | They pay you, deliver under their brand | Agencies wanting to upsell clients |
| **Revenue share** | They sell, you fulfill, split 70/30 | Freelancers without upfront budget |
| **Bulk discount** | 10 scans/month for fixed price | Agencies with predictable volume |
| **Referral fee** | $20-50 per referred customer | Anyone in their network |

**Recommendation:** Start with white-label — agencies love adding services without building anything.

## 📧 Outreach Strategy: The "Free Audit" Method

### Step 1: Research

Before reaching out to any agency:
1. Find their portfolio/case studies on their website
2. Identify 2-3 client websites they've built
3. Run your accessibility scanner on those sites
4. Note specific issues found (number of errors, severity)

### Step 2: Personalized Outreach

#### Email Template #1: Initial Contact

```
Subject: Found some ADA issues on [Client Name]'s website

Hi [Name],

I came across your agency while researching web developers in [City/Niche]. 
I noticed you built [Client Website] — nice work on the design.

I ran a quick accessibility scan and found [X] issues that could expose 
them to ADA lawsuits (these are up 37% this year). Happy to share the 
report free — no strings attached.

If accessibility audits are something your clients ask about, I'd love 
to chat about how I might help your team. I offer white-label reports 
you can deliver under your brand.

Either way, the free report is yours if you want it.

[Your name]
```

#### Email Template #2: Follow-up (Day 4)

```
Subject: Re: Found some ADA issues on [Client Name]'s website

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my previous email. I'd still be happy to share 
that accessibility report for [Client Website] if it's useful.

Quick context: with the ADA Title II deadline in April 2026 and 
lawsuits up 37% this year, I'm seeing more agencies add accessibility 
audits to their service offerings.

Let me know if you'd like to chat for 15 minutes about how this 
could work for your team.

[Your name]
```

#### Email Template #3: Final Follow-up (Day 10)

```
Subject: Last note on accessibility audits

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short — I know you're busy.

If accessibility compliance isn't a priority for your agency right now, 
no worries at all. But if it ever becomes relevant, I'm here to help.

I'll leave the free report offer open. Just reply anytime.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Step 3: Meeting Agenda (When They Respond)

1. **Understand their situation (5 min)**
   - Do clients ask about accessibility?
   - Have any clients been threatened with lawsuits?
   - How do they currently handle accessibility?

2. **Show value (5 min)**
   - Walk through the scan report you generated
   - Explain what issues mean in plain English
   - Mention lawsuit statistics briefly

3. **Propose partnership (5 min)**
   - Offer white-label option
   - Discuss pricing/volume
   - Agree on pilot (e.g., 3 free scans to test)
