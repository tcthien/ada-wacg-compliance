      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "The page contains only one form element - a scheme selector dropdown (<select> with https option) - which is not a user information input field. There are no form inputs collecting user data such as name, email, phone, or address that would require autocomplete attributes. The linked HTML form at /forms/post is not included in this page's content.",

      "confidence": 65,
      "reasoning": "Links on the page appear to rely primarily on color differentiation without additional visual indicators like underlines visible in the static HTML. However, the Swagger UI framework typically provides hover states and the GitHub corner link uses a distinct visual icon. The page does not have error states, required fields, or charts that rely on color alone. Lower confidence due to reliance on CSS styling not fully visible in the HTML.",

      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 90,
      "reasoning": "No audio or video elements are present on this page. There are no <audio>, <video>, or embedded media players that would auto-play. The page is purely a Swagger UI API documentation interface without any media content.",

      "criterionId": "1.4.3",
      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 55,
      "reasoning": "The page uses standard Swagger UI styling with a light background (#fafafa) and default text colors. Swagger UI is a widely-used framework that generally maintains adequate contrast ratios. However, without computed style values, the exact contrast ratios cannot be verified from the HTML alone. The version text in <pre class='version'> and base-url text may use lighter colors typical of Swagger UI.",

      "criterionId": "1.4.4",
      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 50,
      "reasoning": "The page uses standard HTML elements and the Swagger UI framework, which typically supports text resizing. No fixed-width containers with overflow:hidden that would clip text are visible in the inline styles. However, verification of text resizing behavior at 200% zoom requires live testing, reducing confidence in this assessment.",

      "criterionId": "1.4.5",
      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "The page uses real text for all content including headings, descriptions, and navigation. The only images are SVG icons (GitHub corner octicon, expand arrows, lock symbols) which are decorative or UI controls, not text content. No images of text are used for headings, body content, or navigation labels.",

      "criterionId": "1.4.10",
      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 50,
      "reasoning": "The page uses a wrapper-based layout with percentage-based columns (col-12) suggesting responsive design. Swagger UI is designed to reflow content on narrow screens. However, actual reflow behavior at 320px width requires live testing to confirm no horizontal scrolling occurs. The inline styles do not show fixed-width constraints that would prevent reflow.",

    {
      "criterionId": "1.4.11",
      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 55,
      "reasoning": "UI components include buttons (Expand operation), a select dropdown (Schemes), and SVG icons. Swagger UI's default styling typically provides adequate contrast for form controls and icons. The arrow icons use currentColor which inherits from the parent. Without computed styles, exact contrast ratios cannot be verified, but no obvious low-contrast patterns are present in the HTML.",

    {
      "criterionId": "1.4.12",
      "status": "AI_VERIFIED_PASS",
      "confidence": 45,
      "reasoning": "The page uses standard HTML elements without restrictive overflow handling visible in the inline styles. Swagger UI is a modern framework likely to handle text spacing changes gracefully. However, this criterion requires testing with modified CSS properties (line-height, letter-spacing, word-spacing, paragraph spacing) which cannot be verified from static HTML analysis alone.",

      "confidence": 70,
      "reasoning": "The page contains interactive elements (Expand operation buttons, dropdown) that may trigger hover or focus content, but the actual behavior requires JavaScript interaction to verify. The Swagger UI expands API operation details on click. Whether any tooltips or hover content exists and meets dismissibility, hoverability, and persistence requirements cannot be determined from static HTML alone.",
