      "reasoning": "The page provides navigation through section headings with anchor links (#/HTTP Methods, #/Auth, etc.) as a form of table of contents, but lacks a site search functionality, sitemap, or breadcrumb navigation. For a standalone utility page this may be acceptable, but only one navigation method (section links) is clearly present. No search or alternative navigation mechanisms were found.",

Each category heading includes a descriptive subtitle explaining its purpose.",

      "reasoning": "Focus visibility requires keyboard interaction testing to verify focus indicators are visible when tabbing through interactive elements. Static HTML analysis cannot determine if CSS removes focus outlines or if custom focus styles are sufficient. The HTML does not show 'outline: none' in the embedded styles, but external CSS may affect focus visibility.",

No evidence of multipoint gestures (pinch-to-zoom) or path-based gestures (swipe navigation) required for core functionality. The 'Expand operation' buttons provide single-click alternatives.",

Buttons labeled 'Expand operation' have title='Expand operation' matching their function. Links like 'the developer - Website' and 'Send email to the developer' have visible text that serves as their accessible name. No aria-labels that contradict visible text were found.",
