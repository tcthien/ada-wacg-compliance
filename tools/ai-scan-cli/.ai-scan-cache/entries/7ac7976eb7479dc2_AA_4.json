      "reasoning": "The page contains a single dropdown (combobox) for selecting the scheme (https). This is a Swagger UI interface where dropdowns are used for configuration rather than navigation. The dropdown selection changes the API scheme setting but does not cause automatic navigation or form submission. However, full verification would require testing the actual behavior when the dropdown value changes.",

The symbols 'unlocked', 'locked', 'close', 'large-arrow', 'large-arrow-down', 'jump-to', and 'expand' are defined twice in the page - once in the main document's SVG defs and again in the React-generated Swagger UI SVG defs.

Links have descriptive text. The GitHub link has an aria-label. SVG icons within buttons are decorative and the buttons themselves have titles.
