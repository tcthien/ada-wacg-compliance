"8c7bc873-dbd0-425f-9cb9-38e2e0b7904a","This accessibility scan of UtilTools.dev identified 3 issues that create barriers for users with disabilities. The most serious concern is insufficient color contrast, which affects users with low vision, color blindness, or those viewing the site in bright lighting conditions. Text that doesn't meet the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio becomes difficult or impossible to read for these users, effectively hiding content from a significant portion of visitors.

The missing image alt text prevents screen reader users from understanding visual content, leaving them without context about what images represent. This is particularly problematic if the image conveys important information or serves as navigation. Additionally, a link without discernible text means keyboard and screen reader users cannot understand where the link leads, making navigation confusing or impossible.

While the page does include many positive accessibility features (proper heading structure, semantic navigation elements, and ARIA labels on several interactive elements), these three issues should be addressed to ensure the site is usable by people relying on assistive technologies.","QUICK WINS (Can be fixed in hours):
- Add alt text to the image missing alternative text (logo.png)
- Add accessible text to the link that only contains an icon - either visible text, aria-label, or screen-reader-only text
- These two fixes require minimal code changes and immediately improve screen reader accessibility

SHORT TERM (1-2 weeks):
- Audit all color combinations on the site using a contrast checker tool
- Update the color palette to ensure all text meets the 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio (or 3:1 for large text)
- Consider creating a design system with pre-approved accessible color combinations to prevent future issues
- Test the fixes with actual screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify improvements

LONG TERM (Ongoing maintenance):
- Integrate automated accessibility testing into the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues before deployment
- Add accessibility linting rules to the development environment
- Conduct periodic manual accessibility audits, especially after major UI changes
- Consider adding a high-contrast mode option for users who need enhanced visibility","[{""issueId"":""10abc5f1-4c17-46e2-a588-6e08d4dfef34"",""aiExplanation"":""This text has a color contrast ratio of only 3.5:1, but WCAG AA requires at least 4.5:1 for normal-sized text.
